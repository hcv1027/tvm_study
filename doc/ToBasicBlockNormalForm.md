## **Overview of the `ToBasicBlockNormalForm` Pass in TVM**

The `ToBasicBlockNormalForm` pass in TVM is a transformation applied to the Relay intermediate representation (IR), which restructures the program into **Basic Block Normal Form**. This transformation simplifies the control flow of the program, making it easier for subsequent compiler passes to perform optimizations and analyses.

---

## **Understanding Basic Blocks**

### **What is a Basic Block?**

In compiler design, a **basic block** is a straight-line sequence of instructions with:

- **A Single Entry Point**: Control flow enters at the beginning of the block.
- **A Single Exit Point**: Control flow exits at the end of the block.
- **No Internal Branching**: There are no jumps or branches within the block; any control flow changes happen at the end.

**Example of a Basic Block:**

```plaintext
Instruction 1
Instruction 2
Instruction 3
```

If execution starts at Instruction 1, it will proceed sequentially through Instruction 2 and Instruction 3 without any jumps or branches until it exits the block.

## **Basic Block Normal Form in Relay**

### **What is Basic Block Normal Form (BBNF)?**

In the context of TVM's Relay IR, **Basic Block Normal Form** is a way of structuring the program so that:

- The code is organized into basic blocks.
- Control flow constructs are simplified.
- Nested expressions are flattened into sequences of let bindings.
- The program has a standardized structure that simplifies analysis and optimization.

**Characteristics of BBNF in Relay:**

1. **Flattened Nesting**: Nested expressions are transformed into a flat sequence of let bindings.
2. **Simplified Control Flow**: Control flow constructs like conditionals and pattern matching are restructured into basic blocks.
3. **Explicit Sequencing**: The order of execution is made explicit through the sequence of let bindings.

---

## **Purpose of the `ToBasicBlockNormalForm` Pass**

The `ToBasicBlockNormalForm` pass transforms the Relay program into BBNF to:

- **Simplify the Control Flow**: By converting nested expressions and complex control structures into basic blocks.
- **Facilitate Optimizations**: Many compiler optimizations are easier to perform on code in BBNF.
- **Standardize the IR Structure**: Provides a consistent structure for subsequent compiler passes.

---

## **How the Pass Works**

### **Transformation Steps:**

1. **Flatten Nested Expressions**:
   - Nested let expressions and complex expressions within function arguments are lifted to the top level.
   - Each sub-expression is assigned to a variable via a let binding.

2. **Restructure Control Flow**:
   - Control flow constructs (e.g., `if`, `match`) are transformed to fit into basic blocks.
   - Conditional expressions are simplified by evaluating conditions and assigning branches to variables.

3. **Simplify Function Arguments**:
   - Function arguments are simplified so that they are variables or constants, not complex expressions.

### **Example Before and After Transformation**

**Original Relay Code:**

```python
let x = add(mul(a, b), c) in
sqrt(x)
```

**Issues:**

- The expression `add(mul(a, b), c)` is nested.

**After Applying `ToBasicBlockNormalForm`:**

```python
let t1 = mul(a, b) in
let x = add(t1, c) in
sqrt(x)
```

**Explanation:**

- `mul(a, b)` is assigned to `t1`.
- `add(t1, c)` is assigned to `x`.
- The nested expression is flattened into sequential let bindings.

---

## **Detailed Explanation of Basic Block Normal Form**

### **Flattening Nested Expressions**

In BBNF, any complex or nested expressions are broken down into simpler components through let bindings.

**Example:**

```python
# Nested expression
exp = foo(bar(baz(x)))
```

**Transformed into BBNF:**

```python
let t1 = baz(x) in
let t2 = bar(t1) in
let exp = foo(t2) in
exp
```

### **Simplifying Control Flow Constructs**

Control flow constructs are restructured to fit within basic blocks.

**Example with an `if` Expression:**

**Original Code:**

```python
let result = if (x > 0) {
    foo(x)
} else {
    bar(x)
} in
baz(result)
```

**Transformed into BBNF:**

```python
let cond = x > 0 in
let true_branch = foo(x) in
let false_branch = bar(x) in
let result = if cond {
    true_branch
} else {
    false_branch
} in
baz(result)
```

**Explanation:**

- The condition `x > 0` is assigned to `cond`.
- Both branches are computed and assigned to `true_branch` and `false_branch`.
- The `if` expression selects between the two precomputed branches.

---

## **Benefits of Transforming to BBNF**

1. **Simplifies Analysis and Optimization**:
   - With a standardized structure, compiler passes can more easily analyze and optimize the code.

2. **Enables Advanced Optimizations**:
   - Techniques like common subexpression elimination and code motion become more straightforward.

3. **Improves Readability**:
   - The code's structure becomes more explicit, aiding debugging and understanding.

4. **Facilitates Code Generation**:
   - Backend code generators can produce more efficient code when the IR is in a predictable form.

---

## **Relation to Other Normal Forms**

### **A-Normal Form (ANF)**

- In ANF, all intermediate computations are named via let bindings, and function arguments are variables.
- BBNF is similar but specifically focuses on structuring the program into basic blocks.

### **Continuation-Passing Style (CPS)**

- CPS makes control flow explicit by passing continuations (functions representing the "rest of the computation").
- BBNF simplifies control flow without introducing continuations.

---

## **Implementation in TVM**

### **Pass Mechanics**

- The `ToBasicBlockNormalForm` pass recursively traverses the Relay IR, transforming expressions into BBNF.
- It introduces new variables and let bindings as needed to flatten the code.

### **Handling Variables and Scopes**

- Variables introduced in let bindings are scoped appropriately.
- The pass ensures that variable names are unique to prevent naming conflicts.

### **Interaction with Other Passes**

- **Pre-requisite Passes**: The code may need to be in a certain form before applying BBNF (e.g., type inference completed).
- **Subsequent Passes**: Many optimization passes assume the code is in BBNF.

---

## **Practical Example**

Let's consider a Relay function that includes both computation and control flow.

**Original Function:**

```python
fn (%x: Tensor[(1, 64)], %y: Tensor[(1, 64)]) {
    let %z = add(%x, %y);
    let %w = if greater(sum(%z), 0f) {
        multiply(%z, 2f)
    } else {
        subtract(%z, 2f)
    };
    exp(%w)
}
```

**Issues:**

- The `if` expression contains complex expressions.
- Nested computations within function arguments.

**Transformed into BBNF:**

```python
fn (%x: Tensor[(1, 64)], %y: Tensor[(1, 64)]) {
    let %z = add(%x, %y);
    let %s = sum(%z);
    let %cond = greater(%s, 0f);
    let %true_branch = multiply(%z, 2f);
    let %false_branch = subtract(%z, 2f);
    let %w = if %cond {
        %true_branch
    } else {
        %false_branch
    };
    let %result = exp(%w);
    %result
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Intermediate computations like `sum(%z)` and `greater(%s, 0f)` are assigned to variables `%s` and `%cond`.
- Both branches of the `if` are computed and assigned to `%true_branch` and `%false_branch`.
- The final result `%result` is computed after flattening all nested expressions.

---

## **When is `ToBasicBlockNormalForm` Applied?**

- **During Compilation**: The pass is applied as part of the standard optimization pipeline in TVM.
- **Before Optimization Passes**: Ensures that the code is in a suitable form for optimizations that assume BBNF.
- **User Invocation**: Users can explicitly apply the pass if they are performing custom transformations.

**Applying the Pass in Code:**

```python
from tvm import relay

# Assume 'mod' is a Relay module
bbnf_pass = relay.transform.ToBasicBlockNormalForm()
mod = bbnf_pass(mod)
```

---

## **Key Takeaways**

- **BBNF Simplifies the IR**: By flattening nested expressions and simplifying control flow.
- **Facilitates Optimizations**: Makes it easier for the compiler to perform advanced optimizations.
- **Standardizes Program Structure**: Provides a consistent form for subsequent passes.

---

## **Additional Considerations**

### **Scoping and Variable Naming**

- The pass carefully manages variable scopes to ensure correctness.
- Variables are uniquely named to prevent collisions.

### **Impact on Performance**

- While the pass may introduce additional let bindings, it simplifies the code structure.
- The benefits in optimization often outweigh any overhead from additional variables.

### **Limitations**

- The pass assumes that the Relay code is well-formed and type-correct.
- It may not handle certain advanced language features or extensions without modification.

---

## **Conclusion**

The `ToBasicBlockNormalForm` pass in TVM is essential for preparing Relay programs for optimization and code generation. By transforming the code into basic block normal form, it simplifies control flow and expression nesting, making it easier for the compiler to perform efficient optimizations.

## **1. Tracing the Implementation of `ToBasicBlockNormalForm`**

### **Overview**

The `ToBasicBlockNormalForm` pass transforms a Relay program into **Basic Block Normal Form (BBNF)**. This involves restructuring the program so that it consists of basic blocks, simplifying the control flow, and making it suitable for further optimizations.

### **Code Breakdown**

Let's go through the code step by step.

#### **a. Function `ToBasicBlockNormalForm`**

```cpp
IRModule ToBasicBlockNormalForm(const IRModule& mod) {
  // Create a new module by shallow copy.
  IRModule new_mod = mod->ShallowCopy();

  tvm::Map<GlobalVar, Function> updates;
  auto funcs = new_mod->functions;
  for (const auto& it : funcs) {
    ICHECK_EQ(FreeVars(it.second).size(), 0) << "Expected no free variables";
    if (const auto* n = it.second.as<FunctionNode>()) {
      if (n->GetAttr<String>(attr::kCompiler).defined()) continue;
      Function func = GetRef<Function>(n);
      Function ret = Downcast<Function>(ToBasicBlockNormalFormAux(func));
      VLOG(1) << "rewritten:" << std::endl
              << PrettyPrint(func) << std::endl
              << "to BasicBlockANF:" << std::endl
              << PrettyPrint(ret);
      updates.Set(it.first, Downcast<Function>(ret));
    }
  }

  for (auto pair : updates) {
    new_mod->Add(pair.first, pair.second, true);
  }

  return new_mod;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Create a New Module**: The function starts by creating a shallow copy of the input IR module `mod`. This ensures that modifications are made to a new module without altering the original.
  
  ```cpp
  IRModule new_mod = mod->ShallowCopy();
  ```

- **Prepare for Updates**: A map `updates` is created to store the transformed functions.

  ```cpp
  tvm::Map<GlobalVar, Function> updates;
  ```

- **Iterate Over Functions**: The code iterates over each function in the module.

  ```cpp
  auto funcs = new_mod->functions;
  for (const auto& it : funcs) {
    // ...
  }
  ```

- **Check for Free Variables**: It asserts that each function has no free variables. This is important because the transformation assumes that functions are self-contained.

  ```cpp
  ICHECK_EQ(FreeVars(it.second).size(), 0) << "Expected no free variables";
  ```

- **Process Function Nodes**: If the function is a `FunctionNode` and doesn't have an external compiler attribute (i.e., it's not meant to be handled by an external compiler), it proceeds.

  ```cpp
  if (const auto* n = it.second.as<FunctionNode>()) {
    if (n->GetAttr<String>(attr::kCompiler).defined()) continue;
    // ...
  }
  ```

- **Transform to BBNF**: It calls `ToBasicBlockNormalFormAux` on the function to perform the transformation.

  ```cpp
  Function func = GetRef<Function>(n);
  Function ret = Downcast<Function>(ToBasicBlockNormalFormAux(func));
  ```

- **Log the Transformation**: If verbose logging is enabled, it prints the original and transformed functions.

  ```cpp
  VLOG(1) << "rewritten:" << std::endl
          << PrettyPrint(func) << std::endl
          << "to BasicBlockANF:" << std::endl
          << PrettyPrint(ret);
  ```

- **Collect Updates**: The transformed function is added to the `updates` map.

  ```cpp
  updates.Set(it.first, Downcast<Function>(ret));
  ```

- **Apply Updates**: After processing all functions, it updates the module with the transformed functions.

  ```cpp
  for (auto pair : updates) {
    new_mod->Add(pair.first, pair.second, true);
  }
  ```

- **Return the New Module**: The transformed module is returned.

  ```cpp
  return new_mod;
  ```

#### **b. Function `ToBasicBlockNormalFormAux`**

```cpp
Expr ToBasicBlockNormalFormAux(const Expr& e) {
  // calculate all the dependency between nodes.
  support::Arena arena;
  DependencyGraph dg = DependencyGraph::Create(&arena, e);
  /* The scope of the whole expr is global.
   * The scope of any subexpr is the lowest common ancestor of all incoming edges.
   * We also record the set of expressions whose scope is lifted.
   */
  std::pair<NodeScopeMap, ExprSet> scopes = CalcScope(dg);
  return Fill::ToBasicBlockNormalForm(e, dg, &scopes.first, &scopes.second);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Create a Dependency Graph**: It constructs a dependency graph (`DependencyGraph`) of the expression `e`. The dependency graph represents the data dependencies between different parts of the expression.

  ```cpp
  support::Arena arena;
  DependencyGraph dg = DependencyGraph::Create(&arena, e);
  ```

- **Calculate Scopes**: It calls `CalcScope` to compute the scope for each node in the dependency graph and identify expressions that need to be lifted.

  ```cpp
  std::pair<NodeScopeMap, ExprSet> scopes = CalcScope(dg);
  ```

- **Transform to BBNF**: It calls `Fill::ToBasicBlockNormalForm` with the expression, dependency graph, node scopes, and lifted expressions to perform the actual transformation.

  ```cpp
  return Fill::ToBasicBlockNormalForm(e, dg, &scopes.first, &scopes.second);
  ```

#### **c. Function `CalcScope`**

```cpp
std::pair<NodeScopeMap, ExprSet> CalcScope(const DependencyGraph& dg) {
  NodeScopeMap expr_scope;
  ExprSet lifted_exprs;
  std::unordered_map<DependencyGraph::Node*, Expr> node_to_expr;
  for (auto expr_node : dg.expr_node) {
    node_to_expr[expr_node.second] = expr_node.first;
  }
  bool global_scope_used = false;
  Scope global_scope = std::make_shared<ScopeNode>();

  for (auto it = dg.post_dfs_order.rbegin(); it != dg.post_dfs_order.rend(); ++it) {
    DependencyGraph::Node* n = *it;
    auto iit = n->parents.head;
    Scope s;
    if (iit == nullptr) {
      ICHECK(!global_scope_used);
      s = global_scope;
      global_scope_used = true;
    } else {
      s = expr_scope.at(iit->value);
      const auto original_s = s;
      iit = iit->next;
      for (; iit != nullptr; iit = iit->next) {
        s = LCA(s, expr_scope.at(iit->value));
      }
      if (s != original_s && node_to_expr.find(n) != node_to_expr.end()) {
        // filter out exprs whose scope do not matter
        Expr expr = node_to_expr[n];
        if (!expr.as<OpNode>()) {
          lifted_exprs.insert(expr);
        }
      }
    }
    if (n->new_scope) {
      auto child_scope = std::make_shared<ScopeNode>(s);
      expr_scope.insert({n, child_scope});
    } else {
      expr_scope.insert({n, s});
    }
  }
  ICHECK(global_scope_used);
  return std::make_pair(expr_scope, lifted_exprs);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initialize Data Structures**:
  - `expr_scope`: Maps each node to its computed scope.
  - `lifted_exprs`: A set of expressions whose scopes have been lifted (i.e., need to be moved to a higher scope).
  - `node_to_expr`: Maps dependency graph nodes to expressions.

- **Build Node-to-Expression Map**: Populates `node_to_expr` by associating each node with its corresponding expression.

  ```cpp
  for (auto expr_node : dg.expr_node) {
    node_to_expr[expr_node.second] = expr_node.first;
  }
  ```

- **Initialize Global Scope**: Creates a `global_scope` that represents the outermost scope of the program.

  ```cpp
  bool global_scope_used = false;
  Scope global_scope = std::make_shared<ScopeNode>();
  ```

- **Traverse Nodes in Reverse Post-Order**: Iterates over the nodes in the reverse post-order of the dependency graph.

  ```cpp
  for (auto it = dg.post_dfs_order.rbegin(); it != dg.post_dfs_order.rend(); ++it) {
    DependencyGraph::Node* n = *it;
    // ...
  }
  ```

- **Compute Scope for Each Node**:
  - **No Parents**: If the node has no parents (i.e., it's a root node), assign it to the `global_scope`.

    ```cpp
    if (iit == nullptr) {
      ICHECK(!global_scope_used);
      s = global_scope;
      global_scope_used = true;
    }
    ```

  - **Has Parents**: If the node has parents, compute its scope as the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of the scopes of its parent nodes.

    ```cpp
    else {
      s = expr_scope.at(iit->value);
      const auto original_s = s;
      iit = iit->next;
      for (; iit != nullptr; iit = iit->next) {
        s = LCA(s, expr_scope.at(iit->value));
      }
      // ...
    }
    ```

- **Identify Lifted Expressions**:
  - If the computed scope `s` is different from the original scope (i.e., scope has been lifted), and the node corresponds to an expression that is not an operator, add it to `lifted_exprs`.

    ```cpp
    if (s != original_s && node_to_expr.find(n) != node_to_expr.end()) {
      Expr expr = node_to_expr[n];
      if (!expr.as<OpNode>()) {
        lifted_exprs.insert(expr);
      }
    }
    ```

- **Update Scope Map**:
  - If the node represents a new scope (e.g., it's a `let` binding), create a child scope.
  - Otherwise, assign the current scope.

    ```cpp
    if (n->new_scope) {
      auto child_scope = std::make_shared<ScopeNode>(s);
      expr_scope.insert({n, child_scope});
    } else {
      expr_scope.insert({n, s});
    }
    ```

- **Ensure Global Scope is Used**: At the end, it checks that the `global_scope` has been used.

  ```cpp
  ICHECK(global_scope_used);
  ```

- **Return Scopes and Lifted Expressions**: Returns the computed `expr_scope` and `lifted_exprs`.

  ```cpp
  return std::make_pair(expr_scope, lifted_exprs);
  ```

---

## **2. Understanding the LCA Algorithm in `CalcScope`**

### **Purpose of `CalcScope`**

The `CalcScope` function computes the scope for each node in the dependency graph. The scope of a node determines where in the program (i.e., in which basic block) the computation associated with that node should be placed.

### **Scopes and Basic Blocks**

- **Scope**: Represents a block of code (basic block) in which certain expressions are valid.
- **Basic Block**: A sequence of instructions with a single entry point and a single exit point.

### **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) in Scopes**

- **LCA Definition**: In a tree, the LCA of two nodes is the deepest (i.e., lowest) node that is an ancestor of both nodes.
- **In `CalcScope`**: The LCA algorithm is used to find the minimal scope that encompasses all the parent scopes of a node.

### **How LCA is Used in `CalcScope`**

1. **Scope Assignment**:
   - The scope of a node is determined based on the scopes of its parent nodes.
   - If a node has multiple parents, its scope must be a scope that is common to all its parents (i.e., an ancestor in the scope tree).

2. **Computing LCA**:
   - Starting with the scope of the first parent, the code iteratively computes the LCA with the scopes of the remaining parents.

   ```cpp
   s = expr_scope.at(iit->value);  // Start with the scope of the first parent
   const auto original_s = s;
   iit = iit->next;
   for (; iit != nullptr; iit = iit->next) {
     s = LCA(s, expr_scope.at(iit->value));  // Compute LCA with each parent's scope
   }
   ```

3. **Scope Lifting**:
   - If the computed scope `s` is different from the original scope (i.e., the scope has been lifted to a higher level), it means that the node needs to be moved to a higher scope to be visible to all its parents.
   - Such expressions are recorded in `lifted_exprs`.

   ```cpp
   if (s != original_s && node_to_expr.find(n) != node_to_expr.end()) {
     Expr expr = node_to_expr[n];
     if (!expr.as<OpNode>()) {
       lifted_exprs.insert(expr);
     }
   }
   ```

### **Algorithm for LCA Computation**

#### **Scope Representation**

- **ScopeNode**: Represents a scope in the scope tree.
- Each `ScopeNode` may have a parent, forming a tree structure of scopes.

#### **LCA Function**

- The `LCA` function computes the Lowest Common Ancestor of two scopes.

**Implementation Sketch of LCA Function:**

```cpp
Scope LCA(Scope a, Scope b) {
  // Create two sets to store the ancestors of a and b
  std::unordered_set<Scope> ancestors_of_a;
  // Traverse up from scope a, adding each ancestor to the set
  while (a != nullptr) {
    ancestors_of_a.insert(a);
    a = a->parent;  // Move to the parent scope
  }
  // Traverse up from scope b
  while (b != nullptr) {
    // If scope b is in the set of ancestors of a, it's the LCA
    if (ancestors_of_a.find(b) != ancestors_of_a.end()) {
      return b;  // Found the LCA
    }
    b = b->parent;  // Move to the parent scope
  }
  // If no common ancestor is found, return null (should not happen in well-formed trees)
  return nullptr;
}
```

#### **Explanation:**

- **Traversing Up the Scope Tree**:
  - For both scopes `a` and `b`, we traverse up their parent pointers to find their ancestors.

- **Finding the Common Ancestor**:
  - We keep track of the ancestors of one scope (say, `a`) in a set.
  - As we traverse up from the other scope (`b`), we check if any of its ancestors are in the set.
  - The first common ancestor encountered is the LCA.

- **Why This Works**:
  - Since the scope tree is a proper tree (no cycles), the traversal will eventually reach a common ancestor if one exists.

#### **Applying LCA in `CalcScope`**

- The LCA computation ensures that a node is placed in the minimal scope that is accessible from all its parent scopes.
- This is crucial for correctness, ensuring that variables are defined in scopes where they are visible to all their uses.

### **Example to Illustrate LCA in Scopes**

Consider the following simplified dependency graph:

```
Node A (Scope S1)
   |
   v
Node B (Scope S2)
   |
   v
Node C (Scope ?)
```

- **Node A**: Has scope `S1`.
- **Node B**: Has scope `S2`, which is a child of `S1` (`S2` is nested within `S1`).
- **Node C**: Has two parents: Node A and Node B.

**Computing Scope for Node C:**

- **Parents of Node C**: Node A (Scope `S1`) and Node B (Scope `S2`).
- **Compute LCA of Scopes `S1` and `S2`**:
  - Since `S2` is nested within `S1`, the LCA is `S1`.
- **Assign Scope**:
  - Node C is assigned to scope `S1`.

### **Why Lifted Expressions Matter**

- When the scope of a node is lifted (i.e., moved to a higher scope), it may need to be hoisted out of its original scope.
- For example, an expression inside a loop may need to be moved outside the loop if it is used outside.
- These lifted expressions are recorded in `lifted_exprs` to ensure they are correctly placed during the transformation.

---

## **Summary of the Process**

1. **Dependency Graph Creation**: Build a dependency graph representing the data dependencies between expressions.

2. **Scope Calculation**:
   - For each node, compute its scope based on the scopes of its parent nodes.
   - Use the LCA algorithm to find the minimal scope that encompasses all parent scopes.

3. **Identify Lifted Expressions**:
   - Expressions whose scopes have been lifted are identified for special handling.

4. **Transformation to BBNF**:
   - Using the computed scopes and lifted expressions, transform the expression into Basic Block Normal Form.
   - This involves restructuring the program so that it consists of basic blocks with explicit sequencing and simplified control flow.

---

## **Conclusion**

The `ToBasicBlockNormalForm` pass in TVM transforms a Relay program into a standardized form that is easier to optimize and analyze. The `CalcScope` function plays a crucial role in this transformation by computing the scopes of expressions using the Lowest Common Ancestor algorithm. Understanding how scopes and the LCA algorithm are used in this context is essential for grasping how the pass ensures that variables and computations are correctly placed within the program's structure.

---

## **Additional Notes**

- **Why Use LCA for Scopes?**
  - In a program's control flow, variables need to be in scope wherever they are used.
  - By computing the LCA of parent scopes, we ensure that a variable is placed in the earliest (outermost) scope where it is visible to all its uses.

- **Handling of `new_scope` Nodes**:
  - If a node represents a new scope (e.g., a `let` binding introduces a new scope), a child scope is created.
  - This models the nesting of scopes in the program.

- **Optimizations Enabled by BBNF**:
  - Once the program is in BBNF, compiler passes can more easily perform optimizations like:
    - Dead code elimination
    - Common subexpression elimination
    - Loop transformations
    - Memory optimization

- **Importance of Correct Scoping**:
  - Incorrect scoping can lead to variables being undefined where they are used or variables being accessible where they should not be.
  - Proper scope computation is critical for maintaining the correctness of the transformed program.
