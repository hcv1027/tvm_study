### **What is `target` in TVM?**

The `target` parameter in TVM specifies the **device hardware** for which you want to generate code. It tells the compiler:

- **Which backend to use**: For example, `"llvm"` for CPUs, `"cuda"` for NVIDIA GPUs.
- **What code optimizations to apply**: Device-specific optimizations for performance.
- **How to generate the device code**: Including instruction sets and calling conventions.

**Examples of `target` values:**

- `"llvm"`: Generates code for CPUs using the LLVM backend.
- `"cuda"`: Generates code for NVIDIA GPUs using the CUDA backend.
- `"rocm"`: For AMD GPUs using the ROCm platform.
- `"opencl"`: For devices supporting OpenCL.
- `"metal"`: For Apple's Metal framework on macOS and iOS devices.

### **What is `host` in TVM?**

The `host` parameter specifies the **host CPU** architecture for which you need to generate code. This is important because:

- **Host Code**: Even when running on a GPU or other accelerator, you need host code to manage device memory, launch kernels, and handle control flow.
- **Interoperability**: The host code orchestrates the execution of device code and may perform computations not offloaded to the device.
- **Consistency**: The host code must be compatible with the system's CPU architecture.

**Common `host` values:**

- `"llvm"`: This is the most common host target, as LLVM supports a wide range of CPU architectures.

### **Why Do You Need Both `target` and `host`?**

When compiling models for devices like GPUs, the code is split into:

1. **Device Code**: Runs on the GPU (specified by `target`).
2. **Host Code**: Runs on the CPU to manage and invoke device code (specified by `host`).

Specifying both ensures that:

- The **device code** is optimized for the GPU's architecture.
- The **host code** is compatible with the CPU and can effectively control the GPU execution.

### **Setting `target` and `host` for NVIDIA's CUDA GPU**

If you want to run your model on an NVIDIA CUDA GPU:

- **Set `target` to `"cuda"`**: This tells TVM to generate code that can run on NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA.
- **Set `host` to `"llvm"`**: This ensures that the host code is compiled for the CPU using LLVM.

**Example:**

```python
target = tvm.target.Target("cuda", host="llvm")
```

**Alternatively, using a string with options:**

```python
target = tvm.target.Target("cuda -host=llvm")
```

### **Understanding the Compilation Flow**

1. **Model Parsing**: The model (e.g., from ONNX) is parsed into a Relay IR module.
2. **Optimization**: TVM applies graph-level and operator-level optimizations.
3. **Code Generation**: TVM generates code for both the device and the host.
   - **Device Code**: For the GPU, using the CUDA backend.
   - **Host Code**: For the CPU, to set up and manage the execution on the GPU.
4. **Building**: The code is compiled into a deployable module.

---

### **Example Code for Compiling to CUDA GPU**

Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
import onnx
import tvm
import tvm.relay as relay

# Load your ONNX model
onnx_model = onnx.load("simple_model.onnx")
input_name = "input"
shape_dict = {input_name: (1, 4)}
mod, params = relay.frontend.from_onnx(onnx_model, shape_dict)

# Set the target for CUDA GPU and specify the host as LLVM
target = tvm.target.Target("cuda", host="llvm")

with tvm.transform.PassContext(opt_level=3):
    lib = relay.build(mod, target=target, params=params)
```
---

### **Why Not Just Use `target`?**

If you only specify `target` without `host`, TVM assumes that both the device code and host code are for the same architecture. This works for CPUs but not when compiling for GPUs, as the host code (CPU) and device code (GPU) differ significantly.

**Incorrect usage:**

```python
# This will cause issues when compiling for CUDA
target = tvm.target.Target("cuda")

with tvm.transform.PassContext(opt_level=3):
    lib = relay.build(mod, target=target, params=params)
```

This setup lacks the necessary host code information, leading to compilation errors.
